== Deploying Rust contract

[source,sh]
----
solana config set --url localhost
solana-keygen new --force
# Wrote new keypair to ~/.config/solana/id.json

# to show the public key
solana-keygen pubkey ~/.config/solana/id.json

# start test validator and deploy program
solana-test-validator
solana logs

cd example-helloworld/program-rust
cargo build --release  # just download dependencies and check if can be build
# build with solana
cargo build-bpf --manifest-path=./Cargo.toml --bpf-out-dir=dist/program
# test the unit tests and tests directory with Solana runtime switched on
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo test-bpf
# running just unit tests where Solana runtime is not available (e.g. sysvar is not working!)
RUST_BACKTRACE=full cargo test --lib


# deploy
solana program deploy dist/program/testcounter.so
## deployment configuration at: ~/.config/solana/cli/config.yml
## https://explorer.solana.com can be switched to http://localhost:8899 and program id (account) can be checked

export PROGRAM_KEYPAIR=${PWD}/dist/program/testcounter-keypair.json

# NOTE:
# when redeployed with the `deploy` command the new keypair is not generated and the program is just upgraded
